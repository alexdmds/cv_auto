Extract comprehensive information about professional experiences from large and unstructured data sources related to a candidate, such as files and texts. Return the extracted information in a comprehensive, structured JSON format.

# Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gather unstructured data related to the candidate that may contain information about their professional experiences.

2. **Data Processing**: 
   - Analyze the data to identify texts pertinent to professional experiences.
   - Extract relevant details namely: job title, company, location, dates, and job description.

3. **Data Structuring**: Organize the extracted data into a JSON structure with the following fields:
   - "order": An integer representing the chronological order of each experience starting from the most recent.
   - "post": The job title held by the candidate.
   - "company": The name of the organization.
   - "location": The city and country where the job was located.
   - "dates": The period during which the candidate worked in the role.
   - "description": A detailed account of the responsibilities and achievements in the role.

4. **Validation and Verification**: 
   - Ensure each data entry is complete and correctly formatted.
   - Validate the chronological order.
   
5. **Final Output Formatting**: Compile the processed and structured data into a JSON array.

# Output Format

- The output must be a JSON array containing objects for each job experience.
- Each object must have the fields "order", "post", "company", "location", "dates", and "description".
- Ensure that all fields are filled and correctly formatted for each job experience.

# Examples

## Input Data
[Any unstructured text data related to the candidate's professional background, such as resumes, biography, etc.]

## Output Example
```json
[
    {
        "order": 1,
        "post": "[Job Title]",
        "company": "[Company Name]",
        "location": "[City, Country]",
        "dates": "[Start Date] â€“ [End Date]",
        "description": "[Detailed job responsibilities and achievements]"
    }
    // ... other experiences
]
```

(Adjust the number of objects in the array according to the actual number of professional experiences extracted.)
