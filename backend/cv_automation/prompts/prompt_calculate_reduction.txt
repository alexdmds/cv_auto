Optimize the length of a CV, originally a PDF but now represented as a JPG image, so it fits on a single A4 page.

Task:
- Analyze the JPG representing the PDF document.
- Identify the main sections and evaluate their relative lengths.
- If the content exceeds one standard A4 page, suggest concise adjustments with structured JSON indicating section reduction.

# Constraints

1. Propose only one or two sections maximum to be reviewed.
2. Focus solely on content, not formatting or style adjustments.
3. Section names must now be designated by numbers 1 to 4, ranked from top to bottom of the document.

# Output Format

Produce a structured JSON indicating the adjustments with necessary reduction percentages for each section.

Example:

```json
{
  "adjustments": [
    {
      "section": 1,
      "suggested_reduction_percentage": 10
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

# Inputs

- A JPG image containing a CV.

# Notes

- Ensure precise percentage reductions to optimize the document within the constraints.
